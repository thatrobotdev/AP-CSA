This repository holds all of my code for AP Computer Science at my high school.

This repository holds a lot of small assignments, and some big projects for the first semester. Many runners have been removed, and the context for each program might not be complete. Here are some highlights below:

- **[fraction](src/apcs/fraction/Fraction.java)** [(docs)](src/apcs/fraction/doc/apcs/fraction/Fraction.html) - This is a class that models a fraction, with ~25 public methods. This class allows you to store fractions in Java without any loss in precision you would get with float division. It handles edge cases like undefined fractions, as well as input support for mixed fractions and integer operands. It also automatically simplifies any fractions it returns. Each method is mercilessly documented, and mostly unit tested.  
- **[gridWorld](src/apcs/gridWorld)** - A collection of programs experimenting with [GridWorld](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/gridworld-ap-compscience.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-a).
- **[lucky7](src/apcs/lucky7/GameRunner.java)** - A casino game with dice rolling and betting. Runs a simulation to tell you when you should've stopped playing, proving that the game's odds are stacked against you.
- **[pi](src/apcs/pi/PiRunner.java)** - A program that generates PI using three methods with varying precisions.
- **[project1](src/apcs/project1/Project1.java)** - Very simple exploration of strings.
- **[project2](src/apcs/project2/Project2.java)** - Generates an ASCII YIELD sign, with a bonus program that can generate the sign right-side up.
- **[project3](src/apcs/project3/Project3.java)** - Program that converts kilometers to nautical miles.
- **[rect](src/apcs/rect/Rect.java)** - Class that models a rectangle.
- **[student](src/apcs/student/Student.java)** [(docs)](src/apcs/student/doc/apcs/student/Student.html) - Class that models a student.
